**Overview of the Project**

**Project:** Student Grade Tracker

**Objective:**
The primary objective of this project is to develop a simple Java program that allows users to input student grades, calculates the average grade, and determines the corresponding letter grade based on the average.

**Technologies Used:**
**Java:** The core programming language used for developing the application.
**ArrayList:** Used to store the grades dynamically.
**Scanner:** Utilized for capturing user input from the console.

**Features:**

**Grade Input:**
Users can input grades one by one.
The input loop continues until the user enters -1 to signify the end of input.
Grades must be between 0 and 100; otherwise, an error message is displayed.

**Average Calculation:**
The program calculates the average of all valid grades entered by the user.

**Letter Grade Determination:**
Based on the average grade, the program determines and displays the corresponding letter grade:
A for averages 90 and above.
B for averages between 80 and 89.
C for averages between 70 and 79.
D for averages between 60 and 69.
F for averages below 60.

**Result Display:**
If grades are entered, the program displays the average grade and the corresponding letter grade.
If no grades are entered, the program informs the user that no grades were provided.
